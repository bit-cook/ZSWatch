## About

Smartwatch built from scratch, both hardware and software. Built on the [Zephyrâ„¢ Project](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) RTOS, hence the name **ZSWatch** - *Zephyr Smartwatch*.

#### PCB

A 4-layer board that measures 38mm in diameter is designed in KiCad. More info [here](https://github.com/jakkra/ZSWatch-HW).

<kbd><img title="Hardware Overview" src="resources/images/Hardware-Overview.png"/></kbd>

### Software

- Bluetooth LE communications with [GadgetBridge](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge) Android app.
- Also support Bluetooth Direction Finding so the watch can act as a tag and is trackable using any [u-blox AoA antenna board](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/ant-b10-antenna-board)
- Multiple Watchfaces showing:
  - Standard stuff such as time, date, battery
  - Weather
  - Step count
  - Number of unread notifications
  - Environmental data
  - ...
- Pop-up notifications
- [Application picker and app concept](#writing-apps-for-the-application-manager)
  - [Setting menu system, with easy extendability](app/src/applications/settings/)
  - [Music control app](app/src/applications/music_control/)
  - [Settings app](app/src/applications/settings/)
  - [Compass app](app/src/applications/compass/)
  - etc.
- Step counting
- Gestures
- And much more
...

### Watchfaces

The watch supports different watchfaces which can be changed dynamically. The watch also supports ESP32 watchfaces from [Felix Biego](https://github.com/fbiego). Please checkout [this](https://github.com/Kampi/esp32-lvgl-watchface) fork for more informations.

### Smartphone communication

#### Pairing

- In the watch go to `Settings` -> `Bluetooth` -> `Enable pairing`
- Now go reconnect to the watch from the Gadgetbridge app
- You should now be paired

#### Android phone communication

Fortunately, there is a great Android app called [GadgetBridge](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget) that handles everything needed on the phone side, such as notifications management, music control and so much more. The ZSWatch right now pretends to be one of the supported Smart Watches in Gadgetbridge, following the same API as it does. In the future there may be a point in adding native support, we'll see.

#### iOS device communication

Apple exposes [Apple Notification Center Service](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleNotificationCenterServiceSpecification/Specification/Specification.html) GATT server which handles notifications management on the phone side, music control is done in the same fashion using [Apple Media Service](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleMediaService_Reference/Specification/Specification.html)... The ZSWatch communicates straight to the iOS with no extra Apps.

### Enclosure/Casing

3D printed casing with 3D printed buttons, option CNC:able casing in metal.

### Upcomming features

There are almost endless possibilities for features that could be implemented, see [here for full progress](https://github.com/users/jakkra/projects/1) and in GitHub issues.

## Charger/Dock

<img src=".github/images/dock_connector.jpg" width="49%" object-fit="cover"/>
</p>

Option with and without onboard SEGGER J-Link OB debugger. As the debugger requires a license, this will only be available as part of a kit.

See more at [here](https://github.com/jakkra/ZSWatch-Dock).

## Demos

- [HTTP requests over BLE through Gadgetbridge](https://github.com/jakkra/ZSWatch/assets/4318648/12d6e754-ceb3-4efd-9a75-d207aaeb0e82)
- [Watchfaces](https://github.com/jakkra/ZSWatch/assets/4318648/13e43401-1c00-40ab-866f-e6518e61940d)

## Building or getting one

- Head over to the hardware repos for the [PCB](https://github.com/jakkra/ZSWatch-HW) and the [Dock](https://github.com/jakkra/ZSWatch-Dock) for information about ordering the PCBs and assembly from PCBWay
- Go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/jakkra/ZSWatch/wiki/Case,-3D-printing-and-assembling) for information how to print parts and assemble ZSWatch

Some things are still in progress:

- [Building instructions in Wiki](https://github.com/jakkra/ZSWatch/wiki/Case,-3D-printing-and-assembling)
- Dock casing

If you are interested in a kit or want to get notified when the missing parts above are resolved, fill in your **[mail here](https://zswatch.dev/)** and we'll send a reminder when it's ready.

**Or** if you want to get notified for releases and when the missing parts are finished simply press the `Watch` button (next to Fork and Star) -> `Custom` -> `Releases` and you will see in your feed when it's officially released.

## Environment, Compiling and running the code

See [Wiki page about Start Developing](https://github.com/jakkra/ZSWatch/wiki/Start-Developing).

## Writing apps for the Application Manager

See [Wiki page about apps](https://github.com/jakkra/ZSWatch/wiki/Apps).

## Licence GPL-3.0

The main difference from MIT is now that if anyone wants to build something more with this, then they need to also open source their changes back to the project, which I think this is fair. This is so everyone can benefit from those improvements. If you think this is wrong free to contact me and I'm open to change the LICENCE.

## Thanks

### Funding

This project is partly funded through [NGI0 Commons Fund](https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund), a fund established by [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl) with financial support from the European Commission's [Next Generation Internet](https://ngi.eu) program. Learn more at the [NLnet project page](https://nlnet.nl/project/ZSWatch).

**PCBWay** for sponsoring the manufacturing and assembly of some prototype PCBs. PCBWay is the recommended manufacturer for PCBs and assembly of ZSWatch.

**SEGGER** for supporting SEGGER-OB licenses that make the dock a fully functional programmer and debugger for ZSWatch. Thanks to this, the project is much more approachable for persons without a J-Link debugger, letting them have full development and debugging capabilities.
